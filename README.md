##Overview

The pe\_agent module installs, configures and manages the Puppet Enterprise Agent software and the pe-puppet service (the pe-mcollective components are managed by a different module).

##Module Description

The pe\_agent module is dependent on the PE Package Repositories (pe_repo classes) available on any Puppet Enterprise Master version 3.2 or greater. This module was designed so that PE users can easily upgrade their managed PE agents after a version upgrade of a deployment's PE server(s).

##Setup

###What pe\_agent affects

* pe-agent package (and pe-\* packages related to PE)
* /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf configuration file.
* pe-puppet service.

###Beginning with pe\_agent

`include '::pe_agent'` is enough to get you up and running.

```puppet
class { '::pe_agent':
  agent_caserver => 'puppetca.company.lan',
  windows_source => '\\myfileserver\pe-agent'
}
```

###Parameters

The following parameters are available in the pe_agent module:

####`config`

Path to the puppet.conf file (defaults to /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf)

####`package_ensure`

Version of pe-agent to ensure, by default this is set to latest, and uses the 'current'
package repository on the master. *this will auto upgrade agents if master is updated*

If you specify a version number, it may cause issues with general vs specific version
differences (ie 3.2.0 vs 3.2.0.el6.1).

####`master`

Hostname of apt/yum repository with pe-agent packages on it, assumes the hostname is of a PE master
with the required pe_repo classes properly applied to it.  Defaults to the PE master that compiled
the agent's catalog.

####`agent_server` & `agent_caserver` & `agent_environment`

Sets the server, ca_server and environment settings on the agents puppet.conf file.

Defaults to nil and does not manage the settings unless overridden in node classification.

####`staging_dir`

The directory that will be used on AIX and Solaris hosts to temporarily hold the
PE Agent installation files.  This defaults to PE's default: /tmp/puppet-enterprise-installer

####`windows_source`

A UNC path to a publicly-readable SMB share that contains the PE Agent for Windows
MSI files.  Ensure that both 32-bit and 64-bit installers are hosted there; the
default file names are assumed.  The author recommends the use of Distributed File
Services (DFS) namespaces with multiple folder targets to efficiently provide a single
UNC path to the files for multi-site deployments.

####`version`

The desired version of the PE agent to install.  This is applicable to the AIX,
Solaris, and Windows agents since they don't support package => latest.  This
defaults to the version of PE on the agent (which means agent upgrades are armed
unless a newer version is set in the class declaration or hieradata).



##Limitations

This module depends completely on the correct pe_repo classes being added to the target
Puppet Enterprise master servers.  If agent installers aren't present, the install class
of this module will fail.  Best practice is to add pe_repo classes corresponding to
the OS families and architectures of all nodes managed in your infrastructure.

Windows support requires the MSI installers for the PE Agent for Windows to be hosted
outside of the PE environment.

AIX, Debian, RedHat, and Windows OS Families have been tested.  Solaris testing is in
progress.
